#  🌿 Biodiversity-Data-Analysis-Project

Biodiversity is a key indicator of ecosystem health, but it's challenging to measure due to limited data and changing land use. This project analyzes biodiversity data in Great Britain using various statistical techniques in R. The goal is to evaluate how well species like macromaths can serve as indicators of ecological status, compare biodiversity measures, and explore changes over time across different taxonomic groups.
The analysis uses hypothesis testing, correlation, and regression models to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, ultimately providing insights to support conversation efforts and environmental planning.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze biodiversity data and assess ecological indicators by:
-Comparing different biodiversity measures.
-Identify correlations with species count(eg., macromaths).
-Applying hypothesis tests and regression models.
-Visualizing temporal bioidiversity patterns.

## 🧪 Methods Used

- **Data Exploration** (scatter plots, correlation)
- **Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test** for distribution comparison
- **Simple Linear Regression** for ecological relationships
- **Multiple Linear Regression** for prediction
- **Boxplots** for visualizing biodiversity changes over time

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- R and RStudio
- ggplot2, stats, and other base R libraries
